Error=
 The system-wide python installation should be maintained using the system
 package manager (apk) only.

 If the package in question is not packaged already (and hence installable via
 "apk add py3-somepackage"), please consider installing it inside a virtual
 environment, e.g.:

   python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
   . /path/to/venv/bin/activate
   pip install mypackage

 To exit the virtual environment, run:

   deactivate

 The virtual environment is not deleted, and can be re-entered by re-sourcing
 the activate file.

 To automatically manage virtual environments, consider using pipx (from the
 pipx package).
